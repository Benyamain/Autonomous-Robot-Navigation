Goals of this activity:

Being familiar with different Machine Learning applications 
Finding a possible topic for the course project
Finding students with similar interests in a specific topic (it helps with the project team formation)


What you need to do:

1- Look for a Machine Learning application 

2- Write 250-300 words (not including references) about the application. You need to at least address the following questions as much as you can in your response: (6 marks)

What is the problem?
How can Machine Learning help to solve the problem?
Which type of Machine Learning (supervised/unsupervised) can be employed to solve the problem?
Which ML algorithm(s) can be used to solve the problem? (classification, regression, clustering, ...)
What is the type of data (labeled/unlabeled) and which features can be extracted from it?
3- Provide references for your response (1 mark)

4- Read your classmatesâ€™ posts and write a comment for or answer questions asked by at least two classmates (2 marks)

5- Meet deadlines (1 mark):

Deadline for the initial post: Friday, Jan. 17th, at midnight.
Deadline for responses (critical discussions) to at least two classmates' posts: Sunday, Jan. 19th at midnight


Note: The quality of your posts will be determined by the depth and reflection that you offer in your post and to your classmate.
