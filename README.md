# :robot: Integration of CNN and PINN with Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robot Navigation and Object Detection in a ROS-Gazebo Environment :robot:
The integration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a ROS-Gazebo environment.

### Prompt
OpenAI gymnasium with ROS Gazebo interface for reinforcement learning to some task defined, we use cnn and pinn together, where cnn has vision from robot, we use that for robot to navigate through boundaries, which can be learned through reinforcement learning but passed through CNN. reinfrocement learning navigating, sending images, rewarded as CNN is predicting image labels, labels would be the boundaries defined. We can use object detection as well maybe?? Where the ROS has to find the single label object which we trained it on, finds it through vision. That’s the ultimate goal, but reinforcement learning for maneuvering around to stay within boundaries, but also the goal of finding the object label within some environment. We can use PINN to know velocities over time of the dynamics of robot moving, for each tire maybe, and that is helped with reinforcement learning … where output of PINN is helping CNN stay within boundaries?? Maybe by sending feedback to robot to slow down, maintain a speed, etc. is this feasible? 

### Components and Workflow

	1.	Robot and Environment Setup in ROS-Gazebo:
	•	ROS (Robot Operating System): Middleware to control the robot, manage communication, and integrate sensors.
	•	Gazebo: Simulator for creating the robot’s environment, including boundaries and objects to detect.
	2.	CNN for Vision-Based Navigation:
	•	Input: Images from the robot’s camera.
	•	Output: Classification of boundaries and objects.
	•	Training: Use labeled images to train the CNN for boundary detection and object identification.
	3.	PINN for Dynamics Modeling:
	•	Input: Robot states (e.g., position, velocity) and control inputs.
	•	Output: Predicted future states (e.g., velocities, trajectories).
	•	Integration: Use the PINN to model the robot’s dynamics accurately, helping the RL algorithm understand the effects of actions over time.
	4.	Reinforcement Learning for Navigation:
	•	State: Combination of sensor data (from the robot’s sensors and CNN outputs) and predicted states (from the PINN).
	•	Action: Movement commands to the robot (e.g., speed, direction).
	•	Reward:
	•	Positive reward for staying within boundaries.
	•	Positive reward for moving towards and detecting the target object.
	•	Negative reward for collisions or going out of bounds.
	5.	Feedback Loop:
	•	The CNN processes real-time images to detect boundaries and objects, providing input to the RL agent.
	•	The RL agent uses this information, along with PINN predictions, to decide on actions.
	•	The robot performs the actions, and the results (new states) are fed back into the system, updating the CNN and PINN as needed.

### Implementation Steps

	1.	Environment and Robot Configuration:
	•	Define the simulation environment in Gazebo.
	•	Set up the robot with necessary sensors (e.g., cameras, LIDAR).
	2.	CNN Training:
	•	Collect and label a dataset of images with boundaries and objects.
	•	Train the CNN to classify these images accurately.
	3.	PINN Development:
	•	Develop a PINN to model the robot’s dynamics.
	•	Train the PINN using simulation data to predict the robot’s movements accurately.
	4.	Reinforcement Learning Setup:
	•	Define the RL framework (e.g., PPO, DDPG).
	•	Integrate the state space (including CNN outputs and PINN predictions) and action space.
	•	Define the reward structure and train the RL agent.
	5.	Integration and Testing:
	•	Integrate the CNN, PINN, and RL components within the ROS-Gazebo framework.
	•	Test the complete system in various simulated environments.
	•	Fine-tune the models based on performance.
