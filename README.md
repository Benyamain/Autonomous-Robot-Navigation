# :robot: Autonomous Robot Navigation :robot:
The integration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a ROS-Gazebo environment.

### Components and Workflow

	1.	Robot and Environment Setup in ROS-Gazebo:
	•	ROS (Robot Operating System): Middleware to control the robot, manage communication, and integrate sensors.
	•	Gazebo: Simulator for creating the robot’s environment, including boundaries and objects to detect.
	2.	CNN for Vision-Based Navigation:
	•	Input: Images from the robot’s camera.
	•	Output: Classification of boundaries and objects.
	•	Training: Use labeled images to train the CNN for boundary detection and object identification.
	3.	PINN for Dynamics Modeling:
	•	Input: Robot states (e.g., position, velocity) and control inputs.
	•	Output: Predicted future states (e.g., velocities, trajectories).
	•	Integration: Use the PINN to model the robot’s dynamics accurately, helping the RL algorithm understand the effects of actions over time.
	4.	Reinforcement Learning for Navigation:
	•	State: Combination of sensor data (from the robot’s sensors and CNN outputs) and predicted states (from the PINN).
	•	Action: Movement commands to the robot (e.g., speed, direction).
	•	Reward:
	•	Positive reward for staying within boundaries.
	•	Positive reward for moving towards and detecting the target object.
	•	Negative reward for collisions or going out of bounds.
	5.	Feedback Loop:
	•	The CNN processes real-time images to detect boundaries and objects, providing input to the RL agent.
	•	The RL agent uses this information, along with PINN predictions, to decide on actions.
	•	The robot performs the actions, and the results (new states) are fed back into the system, updating the CNN and PINN as needed.

### Implementation Steps

	1.	Environment and Robot Configuration:
	•	Define the simulation environment in Gazebo.
	•	Set up the robot with necessary sensors (e.g., cameras, LIDAR).
	2.	CNN Training:
	•	Collect and label a dataset of images with boundaries and objects.
	•	Train the CNN to classify these images accurately.
	3.	PINN Development:
	•	Develop a PINN to model the robot’s dynamics.
	•	Train the PINN using simulation data to predict the robot’s movements accurately.
	4.	Reinforcement Learning Setup:
	•	Define the RL framework (e.g., PPO, DDPG).
	•	Integrate the state space (including CNN outputs and PINN predictions) and action space.
	•	Define the reward structure and train the RL agent.
	5.	Integration and Testing:
	•	Integrate the CNN, PINN, and RL components within the ROS-Gazebo framework.
	•	Test the complete system in various simulated environments.
	•	Fine-tune the models based on performance.
